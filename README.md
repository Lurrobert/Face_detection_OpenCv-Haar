# Face detection from webcam
Here I have implemented code to capture video from you webcam and draw rectangle on your face.
You can easily try it. Just load the code and run it.
There are 2 options to try:

 - Haar features
 - Neural Network. [MTCNN](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn) library

Haar is faster buy MTCNN is more accurate.
Here is how it works

You can also see jupyter for more detailed version. I tried things there and then wrote beatiful version in Pycharm
